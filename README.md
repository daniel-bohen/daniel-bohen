My name is Daniel Bohen, and I am a computer science student broadly interested in intelligent cyber physical systems. 

I'm currently focused on neurosymbolic programming, trustworthy machine learning, and applying artificial intelligence to resource constrained environments. I am working at the USC Information Sciences Institute for Dr. Luis Garcia on NeuroIoT with a focus on knowledge informed egocentric understanding for safe control systems. Additionally, I am working as a Machine Learning Researcher for Loma Linda University Medical Center on a variety of clinical research projects. 

This summer I will be working for Lockheed Martin's autonoumous helicopter division on perception and path planning. Further, in the future, I hope to pursue a PhD in Computer Science with a focus on neurosymbolic programming and its applications to cyber physical systems. I will also likely continue to work on applying AI to healthcare tasks whenever I can.
